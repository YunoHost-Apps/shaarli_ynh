It is based on the community version of Shaarli (from @sebsauvage original software).

Current version: **0.9.2**

Maintainer: @Lapineige

NB: see https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/shaarli_ynh/tree/v0.0.41beta if you need a very stable (but old) version.

Help for dev/testing hightly appreciated :)


## Installation information

When doing the installation you will be prompted if you want to have a public site, meaning that you don't have to be a user of this Yunohost instance to access the site.

You will also be asked if you want to   have a private instance, meaning that the authentication will be deactivated and the application will be only available to the owner designed during install.
