shaarli_ynh - Shaarli app for Yunohost
===========
This app intends to provide to Yunohost's users Shaarli (https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli), a simple but advanced bookmarking service.

It is based on the community version of Shaarli (from @sebsauvage original software).

Current version: **0.9.2**

Maintainer: @Lapineige

[![Install Shaarli with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.png)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=shaarli)

**Work In Progress** - the packaging is usable and  almost complete, but need more tests.
Please backup your data (with export + yunohost backup) before updating the app.

NB: see https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/shaarli_ynh/tree/v0.0.41beta if you need a very stable (but old) version.

## Installation information

When doing the installation you will be prompted if you want to have a public site, meaning that you don't have to be a user of this Yunohost instance to access the site.

You will also be asked if you want to   have a private instance, meaning that the authentication will be deactivated and the application will be only available to the owner designed during install.

    * Integrate the ssowat authentication (currently the authentication is done by Shaarli)
    * Add upgrade script
    * Refactoring of the code
